wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/master/weights/tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
```

3. **Firebase Configuration:**
   The Firebase config is already set up in `src/firebase.ts`. The project is connected to the Firebase project `today-only-17f6e`.

### Running the Application

**Development mode:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üéØ Firebase Collections Structure

```
sessions/
  {sessionId}/
    - userId: string
    - startTime: Timestamp
    - endTime: Timestamp | null
    - isActive: boolean

    tasks/
      {taskId}/
        - title: string
        - description: string
        - notes: string
        - completed: boolean
        - createdAt: Timestamp
        - updatedAt: Timestamp

    breaks/
      {breakId}/
        - startTime: Timestamp
        - duration: number
        - endTime: Timestamp

    activityLogs/
      {logId}/
        - timestamp: Timestamp

        - details: string
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19 with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)
- **Face Detection:** face-api.js
- **Audio:** Web Audio API
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Utilities:** Lodash, date-fns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Camera Permission:** The app requires camera access for focus mode. Make sure to allow camera permissions when prompted.

2. **Browser Compatibility:** Face detection works best in Chrome/Edge. Safari may have limitations.

3. **Performance:** The face-api.js models add ~5MB to the bundle size. This is expected for face detection functionality.

4. **Audio Context:** Some browsers require user interaction before playing audio. The first beep might be delayed.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Camera not working:**

- Check browser permissions
- Ensure you're using HTTPS (or localhost)
- Try refreshing the page

**Face detection not working:**

- Ensure models are in `public/models/`
- Check console for loading errors
- Make sure lighting is adequate

**Firebase errors:**

- Check internet connection
- Verify Firebase rules allow read/write for authenticated users
- Check console for specific error messages

## üìù Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)

- Charts and visualizations
- Export session data
- Custom notification sounds
- Dark/light theme toggle
