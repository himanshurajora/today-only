# Testing Guide for Today Only

## How to Test the Latest Features

### 1. Face Detection (10-Minute Intervals)

**What to test:**

- Face detection only happens every 10 minutes, not continuously
- Camera stops after each check

**Steps:**

1. Start a work session
2. Start a focus session (you can set it to 30+ minutes)
3. **Wait 10 minutes** (or temporarily change the interval in code to 1 minute for testing)
4. You should see:
   - Camera indicator in bottom-right shows countdown: "Next check: 9:59, 9:58..."
   - At 10:00 mark, indicator shows "Checking now..."
   - Video preview appears in center of screen for ~2 seconds
   - Camera turns off automatically after check
5. Countdown resets to 10:00 and repeats

**To test fast (for development):**

```typescript
// In FocusTimer.tsx, change these lines temporarily:
- setTimeUntilNextCheck(600); // 10 minutes
+ setTimeUntilNextCheck(60); // 1 minute for testing

// And:
- }, 10 * 60 * 1000); // 10 minutes
+ }, 60 * 1000); // 1 minute for testing
```

### 2. Stop Beep When Alert Dismissed

**What to test:**

- Low-frequency beep stops when you click "I'm Back!"

**Steps:**

1. Start focus session
2. Wait for a face detection check (10 minutes)
3. **Move away from camera** during the check
4. Alert dialog appears with loud low-frequency beep

### 3. Focus Session Persistence (from v1.1)

**What to test:**

- Focus timer survives page reload

**Steps:**

1. Start work session
2. Start 30-minute focus session
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. **Reload the page (F5 or Cmd+R)**
5. âœ… Timer should show ~25 minutes remaining (not 30)
6. âœ… Beep intervals continue from where you left off

**Steps:**

1. Open another app that uses camera (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
2. Start a call or activate camera there
3. Start focus session in Today Only

## Expected Timings

- **Focus Timer:** Counts down from set duration
- **15-Minute Beep:** Every 15 minutes exactly
- **Face Check:** Every 10 minutes (600 seconds)
- **Face Check Duration:** ~2 seconds (1 second camera warm-up + detection)
- **Beep Stop:** Immediate (< 0.1 second fade-out)
- **Break Timer:** Counts down from set duration

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Camera not working?

- Check browser permissions
- Close other apps using camera
- Refresh page
- Try Chrome/Edge (best compatibility)

### Face detection not triggering?

- Wait full 10 minutes
- Check countdown timer in bottom-right
- Ensure good lighting
- Face the camera directly

### Beep not stopping?

- Click "I'm Back!" button (not just close dialog)
- If still playing, refresh page
- Check browser audio settings

### Timer not persisting?

- Check internet connection (Firebase)
- Look for console errors
- Ensure session is active before reload

## Browser Console Commands (for testing)

Open browser console and try these:

```javascript
// Check if focus session is saved
// (You can inspect Firebase data in browser dev tools)

// Manually trigger face check (useful for testing)
// Note: This requires accessing React component state
// which is not directly accessible from console

// For faster testing, modify intervals in code directly
```
